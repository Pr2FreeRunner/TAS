# PR2 Speedrun Tools by Suuper
Now you can make TASes of PR2 yourself!

Ask questions and maybe I'll answer. 
Post bugs and maybe I'll fix them someday. If you're posting a bug, please include the details of the error and steps to reproduce the bug. (If I don't have either of those, there is absolutely no way for me to fix it.)

To create a video you'll have to use an external program to convert a series of images into a video file. Unfortunately I don't know how to directly create video files in my program. Don't worry, though, you can easily share recordings and ghosts with other people who have this program.
